# Volume Hand Control
## A Computer Vision Project
This program utilizes **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to track your hands through a connected webcam. By calculating the distance between your fingers, the program changes the volume on your computer.

To install **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** :
```
pip install opencv
pip install mediapipe
```

This project also utilizes **NumPy** which can be installed with:
```
pip install numpy
```

For this project, I followed a tutorial on YouTube, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iEPzbG-xLE). Due to the age of the video, there are differences in the code due to MediaPipe having been updated since.
