# Volume Hand Control
## A Computer Vision Project
This program utilizes **OpenCV, MediaPipe,** and **PyCaw** to track your hands through a connected webcam. By calculating the distance between your fingers, the program changes the volume on your computer.

To install all needed dependencies do:
```
pip install opencv
pip install mediapipe
pip install pycaw
pip install numpy
```


For this project, I followed a tutorial on YouTube, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iEPzbG-xLE). Due to the age of the video, there are differences in the code due to MediaPipe having been updated since.
